# Parts-Kioske
The goal for this project is to build a kiosk for people to use to help me keep control of my inventory. Instead of using pen, paper, and a binder with dividers to keep track of information, I can use a barcode scanner to scan the part number and serial number of items. I can link the scanner to a Raspberry Pi using Raspbian lite and have it connected to a touch screen for user interface. The UI will be a GUI, a  user can initiate a session, scan the part numbers into a list as well as their serial numbers if applicable, and then close the session by signing their name and what destination they want to charge these parts out to.
